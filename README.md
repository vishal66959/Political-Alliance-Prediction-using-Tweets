# Political-Alliance-Prediction-using-Tweets
Political Alliance Prediction using Tweets  In this project we studied the problem of predicting the political alliance of parties using Tweets and Twitter Network, showing that the political alliance of parties can be predicted from their Twitter behavior. The work involves applying computational politics over a large dataset including Tweets and Mentions Network of Indian Politicians. In this study, we have taken both Structural and Content similarity to predict the alliance.  First, we analysed the networks using the Gephi tool. Secondly, we calculated the EI index of among communities/political parties, the content similarity and the sentiment of the tweets. Finally, we combined the results of these measurements and predicted the probability of the alliance.
